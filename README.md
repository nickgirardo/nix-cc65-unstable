## nix-cc65-unstable

A Nix flake for [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65)

There is a Nix package for the most recent release of cc65, but cc65 doesn't have a regular release schedule so it's many years behind `master`.
The next cc65 release will likely not be for a long while, as there are many issues that they would like to handle [before making a new release](https://github.com/cc65/wiki/wiki/Before-the-next-release).

Currently the commit this uses is [03d824e13b5e01d23d19c0150081a3024b539acd](https://github.com/cc65/cc65/tree/03d824e13b5e01d23d19c0150081a3024b539acd) from July 15th. If you would this to point to a newer commit, please make an issue or pull request.
